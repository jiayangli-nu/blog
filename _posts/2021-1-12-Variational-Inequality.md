title: Variational Inequality Theory
---

	In this post, we will breifly introduce variational inequality (VI) theory. 

Accompanying the activity in computational economics is a need for the unification, documentation, and presentation of fundamental methodologies for use by both researchers and practitioners.

Variational inequality theory will be utilized throughout the book as the fundamental methodology in syn- thesizing network economic equilibrium models operating under a spectrum of behavioral mechanisms and ranging from spatial price equilibrium prob- lems and imperfectly competitive oligopolistic market equilibrium problems to general financial equilibrium problems.

## 1. What is VI?

Given a constraint set $$\mathcal{Z} \subseteq \mathbb R^n$$ and a function $$F: \mathcal{Z} \to \mathbb R^n$$, a VI problem $$\textsc{VI}(F, \mathcal{Z})$$ is to find $$z^* \in \mathcal{Z}$$ such that

$$
    \left< F(z^*),  z - z^*  \right> \geq 0, \quad \text{for all}~z \in \mathcal{Z}.
    \label{eq:vi}
$$
