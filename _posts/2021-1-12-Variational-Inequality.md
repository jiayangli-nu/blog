title: Variational Inequality Theory
---

In this post, we aim to introduce some fundamental methodologies in the variational inequality (VI) theory. However, it can still provide a unified framework in the study of game theory, reinforcement learning. T

unification, documentation, and presentation of fundamental methodologies for use,

## 1. What is VI?

Given a set $$\mathcal{Z} \subseteq \mathbb R^n$$ and a function $$F: \mathcal{Z} \to \mathbb R^n$$, a VI problem $$(F, \mathcal{Z})$$ is to find $$z^* \in \mathcal{Z}$$ such that

$$
    \left< F(z^*),  z - z^*  \right> \geq 0, \quad \text{for all}~z \in \mathcal{Z}.
$$
