title: End-to-End Design and Intervention in Games
---

In this post, we will introduce our paper [*end-to-end design and learning in games*](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.13834.pdf). This paper provides a unified framework for learning and intervention in games.

## 1. What is VI?

Given a set $$\mathcal{Z} \subseteq \mathbb R^n$$ and a function $$F: \mathcal{Z} \to \mathbb R^n$$, a VI problem $$(F, \mathcal{Z})$$ is to find $$z^* \in \mathcal{Z}$$ such that

$$
    \left< F(z^*),  z - z^*  \right> \geq 0, \quad \text{for all}~z \in \mathcal{Z}.
